    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>
      We're <a href="https://umamicart.com/">Umamicart</a>, an early-stage startup delivering your favorite Asian
      groceries üç£ü•üüçúüç•, fresh and to your home, for those with an emotional
      connection to Asian cuisines.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/a.png" alt="Food box" />
    <p>
      We're a team of passionate and multidisciplinary people, working to produce a
      delightful user experience, and
      provide
      best-in-class food experience ü§§
    </p>
    <p>
      From a technical standpoint, we're building a full stack e-commerce platform, from desktop, mobile and internal
      tools
      (for
      data integration, order tracking and others), everything leveraged by a wide range of tools and technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are a small, remote-friendly company based on NYC üóΩ, with the technical team spread across Spain. We've just
      closed our seed-funding round with <a href="https://fjlabs.com/">FJ Labs</a>, which is one of the main tech
      investment funds in marketplaces across
      the globe.
    </p>

    <h2>What are we looking for?</h2>
    <p>
      We need <strong>our second frontend developer</strong>, that will work on our current storefront portal
      (based on Shopify with Liquid templates) and also in our mobile apps (using ReactNative). You'll be an early
      member of the tech team, growing from scratch and positioning yourself as
      a reference member for future developers.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/b.png" alt="DIY sushi kit" />
    <p>
      We are looking for someone experienced enough to not only do a great engineering job but also to understand the
      priorities and tradeoffs of an early startup. In early stages the best solution is usually the quickest one,
      without
      creating too much tech debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll need to create the frontend architecture from scratch, defining processes like bundling, transpiling,
      deploying, etc. You‚Äôll start small, and the architecture and processes will emerge step by step.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the headquarters are in NYC, you'll need to be able to communicate confidently in English with the team.
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-xu-she-her-35ba9435/">Andrea, our CEO</a> and <a
        href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wsumnernichols/">Will, our COO</a>, are the co-founders and they're
      the ones that will communicate the product vision to the tech team.
      You'll report to
      our CTO, based in Spain, so speaking Spanish fluently will
      definitely help. He will work along with you on every
      feature,
      helping to define and refine the architecture, setting tasks and dependencies, understanding hidden traps, and
      everything
      that you need along the way. He will also will help you in your career path, making sure that you grow at least as
      much as the
      product
      and the company do.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/c.png" alt="Some snacks" />
    <p>
      Our current stack is very lean, because right now we're focused on creating all the features of the products. Just
      as
      a reference, we use so far:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Shopify</strong> as the master piece to manage our e-commerce flows: users, products, inventory etc.
        Inside
        the Shopify
        ecosystem, we use several apps,to extend its functionality (SKU Vault, Accentuate Custom Fields, Klaviyo
        integration,
        etc.)
      </li>
      <li><strong>React</strong> et al. for frontend development.</li>
      <li><strong>ReactNative</strong> for mobile apps, using Expo for first MVP, we'll see later.</li>
      <li><strong>GraphQL</strong> and <strong>REST</strong> APIs consumption. Understand both approaches, experience
        with
        Apollo GraphQL client.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>GCP</strong> for cloud infrastructure: cloud scheduler for recurrent tasks, cloud functions for webhooks
        and serverless
        code,
        etc.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Python</strong> for some automation and data-intensive internal products.</li>
      <li>A bunch of integrations with third parties, for digital marketing, social media, carrier providers, etc.</li>
      <li>Other lightweight tools like Airtable, Notion, etc. that may be integrated in different devops-like
        automations.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Are you a good fit?</h2>
    <p>
      It is hard to answer a question like this here, but here goes a list of challenges you should find yourself
      excited
      about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You'll be definitely building an exciting product from scratch, so you need to be excited of working on a
        greenfield project, with loads of
        decisions yet to be make. In an early stage like this, you'll need to balance several factors, and watching out
        to over-engineered
        solutions.
        You
        need to understand the reasons behind every feature request, analyze alternatives, weigh the tradeoffs, and
        choose
        the
        solution with the best cost/benefit ratio. Probably weeks or months later, you'll revisit this feature, and
        you'll evolve it
        iteratively, pay back some tech debt and refine the solution with more data and experience in your pocket.
      </li>
      <li>
        You like technology, frameworks and programming languages, but what you like most is to solve real business
        needs
        with
        technology. You're the chef which uses the best tools and ingredients available to produce delightful dishes and
        experiences. You aren't a knife-sharpener, or an oven engineer that creates cutting-edge technology for other
        chefs.
      </li>
      <li>
        You're open to a wide range of problems, solutions and tools. The most obvious solution can be the worst one.
        You
        always look for the simplest, easiest, fastest way to solve a problem, without creating new ones.
      </li>
      <li>You consider yourself a data-driven decision maker. You gather data, analyze it and decide the next move based
        on the
        insights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Great challenges make great fun, if you agree, we‚Äôd love to speak with you!</p>
